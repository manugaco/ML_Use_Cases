# Use business cases:

The goal of this repository is to create jupyter notebooks with toy examples of some of the use cases of the business problems I have worked in my data science career. It contains:

(Currently building the repository)

### Consumption prediction:
  - Time series Statistical Learning approach to predict future water consumption (ARIMA).
  - Time series Machine Learning approach to predict future water consumption (Prophet).
  - Time series Deep Learning approach to predict future water consumption (LSTM).

### Customers Churn Prediction:
  - -- **DONE** -- Supervised Statistical Learning approach to predict the probability of churn of each client (Logistic regression).
  - -- **DONE** -- Supervised Machine Learning approach to predict the probability of churn of each client (Boosting Trees).

### Customers Lifetime Value Prediction:
  - Statistical Learning approach to measure the averaged profit of a given customer (BG/NBD Gamma-Gamma).

### Customers Segmentation:
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to perform clients segmentation (Hierarquical clustering).
  - -- **DONE** -- Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to perform (RFM) clients segmentation (k-means clustering).

### Fraud Detection:
