# User cases

The goal of this repository is to create jupyter notebooks of user cases of business problems. It contains:

- Clients Segmentation:
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to perform clients segmentation (Hierarquical clustering).
  - Recency Frequency and Monetary (RFM) clients segmentation (k-means clustering).

- Clients Churn Rate Prediction:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to predict the probability of churn of each client (Logistic regression). 

- Fraud Detection:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients consumption (Ensemble models).
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients consumption (DBScan clustering).
  - Unsupervised Deep Learning approach to detect fraud on clients card transactions (Autoencoders).
