  - RFM clients segmentation.

- Clients Churn Rate Prediction:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to predict the probability of churn of each client (Logistic . 

- Fraud Detection:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients consumption (Ensemble models)
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients card transactions (K-nn).
  - Unsupervised Deep Learning approach to detect fraud on clients card transactions (Autoencoders).
