# User business cases:

The goal of this repository is to create jupyter notebooks of user cases of business problems. It contains:

### Consumption prediction:
  - Time series Machine Learning approach to predict future water consumption (Boosting Trees)

### Customers Churn Rate Prediction:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to predict the probability of churn of each client (Logistic regression). 

### Customers Lifetime Value Prediction:
  - Statistical Learning approach to measure the averaged profit of a given customer (BG/NBD Gamma-Gamma).

### Customers Segmentation:
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to perform clients segmentation (Hierarquical clustering).
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to perform (RFM) clients segmentation (k-means clustering) done.

### Fraud Detection:
  - Supervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients consumption (Boosting Trees) done.
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning approach to detect fraud on clients consumption (DBScan clustering) done.
  - Unsupervised Deep Learning approach to detect fraud on clients card transactions (Autoencoders) done.

### Pricing:

### Sales prediction:
  - Time series statistical learning approach to predict future sales (ARIMA).
  - Time series deep learning approach to predict future sales (Prophet).

### Sentiment Analysis:
  - Supervised Statistical Learning approach to classify tweets sentiment (Na√Øve Bayes).

### Topic detection:
  - Unsupervised Statistical Learning approach (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
